Netx is a python script made with [Pexpect](https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/) lib. Netx provides you a fully interactive shell. 
You can use this Python script in [CTF challanges](https://hackthebox.eu) where you have to use Netcat listener and after getting a shell, you make it an interactive shell.
It can be frustrating sometimes. this python script will do the same without wasting your precious time. But it is only for Linux.
